GabrilH: @workspace   Is it possible to mock some SUT business layer’s modules, namely services,
in order to remove dependencies and test these modules separately? If yes,
pick two modules A and B, where B has a dependency on A, mock A and
test B using Mockito. If not, explain why you cannot use Mockito as it
is, and propose what kind of refactoring would the SUT’s business layer
need, in order to perform these mocking tests. Show an example to explain
your methodology, by refactoring part of the project and including one test
using Mockito.

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationCurrently, **it is not possible to mock the business layer services in your SUT as they are**, because both `CustomerService` and `SaleService` are implemented as `enum` singletons and **do not have explicit dependencies on each other via fields or constructor parameters**. All dependencies are created internally (e.g., `new CustomerRowDataGateway()`), so you cannot inject mocks.

### Why Mockito can't be used as-is

Mockito can only mock dependencies that are injected (via constructor, setter, or field). Since your services instantiate their dependencies directly, you cannot replace them with mocks in tests.

---

## Refactoring Proposal

**Refactor the services to use dependency injection** (e.g., via constructor or setter). This allows you to inject mocks for testing.

Suppose you want to test a new `SaleService` method that depends on `CustomerService` (e.g., to check if a customer exists before adding a sale). You need to:

1. Add a `CustomerService` dependency to `SaleService`.
2. Refactor `SaleService` to accept this dependency via constructor.
3. In your test, inject a mock `CustomerService` into `SaleService`.

---

### Example Refactoring

#### 1. Refactor `SaleService` to accept a `CustomerService` dependency

````java
// ...existing code...
public class SaleService {
    private final CustomerService customerService;

    public SaleService(CustomerService customerService) {
        this.customerService = customerService;
    }

    public void addSale(int customerVat) throws ApplicationException {
        // Use customerService to check if customer exists
        customerService.getCustomerByVat(customerVat);
        // ...existing code...
    }
    // ...existing code...
}
// ...existing code...
````

#### 2. Example Mockito Test

````java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class SaleServiceTest {
    @Test
    void addSale_checksCustomerExists() throws Exception {
        CustomerService mockCustomerService = mock(CustomerService.class);
        SaleService saleService = new SaleService(mockCustomerService);

        int vat = 123456789;
        // Stub: customer exists
        when(mockCustomerService.getCustomerByVat(vat)).thenReturn(new CustomerDTO(/*...*/));

        // Exercise
        saleService.addSale(vat);

        // Verify
        verify(mockCustomerService).getCustomerByVat(vat);
    }
}
````

## Summary

- **No, you cannot use Mockito as-is** because dependencies are not injected.
- **Refactor services to use dependency injection**.
- **Inject mocks in tests** to isolate and test modules separately.

See CustomerService.java and SaleService.java for the current code.

# CURSOR:

To use this in your project, you would need to:
Add Mockito to your pom.xml
Create the interfaces
Refactor the service implementations to use dependency injection
Update any references to the old enum-based singletons throughout the codebase
In conclusion, it is possible to mock business layer modules like services in this application, but the current implementation as enum singletons makes it difficult. The necessary refactoring steps involve:
Creating interfaces for the services
Refactoring the services to use dependency injection
Using Mockito to create mock implementations of the interfaces for testing
This approach allows module B (SaleService) to be tested independently of module A (CustomerService) by mocking A's behavior, which is the essence of unit testing with mock objects.
